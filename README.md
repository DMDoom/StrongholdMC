# StrongholdMC

**This is work in progress. Currently not available for download.** <br />

This application takes four measurements in-game as input and calculates estimated position of the stronghold. In the minecraft speedrunning community it is often referred to as "triangulation".
To make it convenient, the app scans for keyboard input to automatically paste coordinates upon copying them using F3 + C command in-game. As it currently stands, being external software,
this app is not allowed in official speedruns and using it may result in run invalidation or a ban.

### How to use <br />
1. Launch the app
2. Press F3 + C while in game, throw a pearl, walk to the pearl location, press F3 + C again
3. Walk a number of blocks away (the further away you are from the stronghold, the more you should walk for accurate measurement)
4. Repeat step 2
5. The app should by now show coordinates of the stronghold

### TODO:
- Add markers to tell the user how accurate the measurement is based on angle of the intersecting lines
- THe smaller the angle, the less accurate the measurement
- Add fat jar download
- Optimize this fx mess
